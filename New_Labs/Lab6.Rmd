### __Goal of Lab 6:__
<h4> In this lab, we are going to explore the acoustic correlates of _obstruent place of articulation_. We shall see that the location of these correlates differ in stops vs. fricatives: while they are mainly “intrinsic” (within the consonant) for fricatives, they are mainly “extrinsic” (in the transitions to adjacent vowels) for stops. This phonetic fact can help to explain cross-linguistic phonological restrictions on adjacent consonants. </h4>

#### __RECORDING__

Go to eClass and download the zip file "Lab6_Soundfiles", containing the following files. Note, you can also generate these sound files, which would contain the sound sequences listed.

| _File name_            | _Sounds to record_             |
|:----------------------:|:------------------------------:|
|Lab6_a_stop_a.wav       |  apa, aba, ata, ada, aka, aga  |
|Lab6_a_stop.wav         |  lap, lab, bat, bad, rack, rag |
|Lab6_i_stop_i.wav       |  ipi ibi, iti, idi iki, igi    |
|Lab6_a_fricative_a.wav  |  afa, aθa, asa, aʃa, aha       |

#### __INSTRUCTIONS__
##### __SECTION I. STOP CONSONANTS__

Several acoustic correlates distinguish different places of articulation in stops. The main ones are VOT, spectral pattern during aspiration (voiceless stops), and transition into the adjacent vowels. For this lab, we will focus on formant transitions in this section; we will discuss __VOT__ and __spectral pattern__ in class. Focus on the differences associated with place of articulation (i.e. the differences between /p b/, /t d/ and /k g/.

* Open the following sound files in Praat: __Lab6_a_stop_a.wav__ and __Lab6_i_stop_i.wav__
* Focus on the voiced stops for now

<br>

1. In Table 6.1, note down the formant transition shape (particularly F2) between each voiced stop and the following [a] or [i] vowel (see Figure 6.1).

* Zoom in so that you can clearly see the formant transition from the stop into the following vowel.

2. Note down the movement contour of __F2__ (and F1 if you can see it) into the following vowel.

##### __SECTION II. FRICATIVES__

Different places of articulation in fricatives are correlated with two main properties: spectral content and relative amplitude. By examining the overall spectral contour, peak frequency and the amplitude of peak frequency, we can have an idea of the properties of a fricative.

<br>

3. Use Table 6.2 to fill in the measurements you take on these three dimensions and compare between fricatives of different POA.

<br>

For this portion of the lab, make sure that the spectrogram is set to display frequencies up to
__9000 Hz__:

* Spectrum > Spectrogram settings...
* View range: up to 9,000 Hz
* Open the following sound file in Praat: __Lab6_a_fricative_a.png__
* Select approximately __40ms__ in the middle of each fricative
* __Spectrum > View spectral slice__
* For each fricative:
  + Take a screenshot of the spectral slice and paste it into your lab Word document. (If you can’t remember how to do this, refer to in in LAB 1 Figure 1.10). Be sure to give the spectral slice an appropriate title.
  + Note down the __spectral peak__ in Table 6.2: the frequency or frequencies around which most of the energy is centered, i.e. the highest amplitude frequencies (the highest peaks)
  + Note down the __amplitude__ of the peak frequency or frequencies in Table 6.2 (this is the amplitude of those noted down in the previous bullet point). Note that the positive dB values are louder than the negative dB values

> __TIP__:  
You can also get a good idea of the frequency ranges and their relative amplitudes by looking at the spectrogram.
>
For English, "ballpark" measurements for [s] will be around 9,000Hz or higher, and for [ʃ] will be somewhere close to 5,000Hz.

<br>

__Q1:__ How do the different places of articulation differ with respect to the F2 transitions into the following vowels? What causes these differences?

__Q2:__ Looking specifically at [ada] and [idi], do you notice a difference in the formant transitions?
What do you think causes this difference?

__Q3:__ Among the fricatives you measured, which ones are highest/lowest in amplitude? What do you think is the reason for this (think about articulation)?

__Q4:__ Compare the spectral peaks of [s] vs. [ʃ]. What do you think causes the difference between these two fricatives?

__Q5:__ Provide a reference and very brief summary of one academic paper that uses the methods covered in this lab.
